This is basically just reinterpreting the exercise work's task description.

first page says these things:
ONE HAS TO DO THESE
	sense movement, which causes an alarm
	read keypad

THE OTHER ONE HAS TO
	display alarm system states
		password input relayed from other arduino

		needed:
			movement detection (can be just buzzer)
			password time limit ran out

		examples:
			connection status			
			similar features



EITHER HAS TO
	sound alarm when needed.


so the system needs to:
	detect motion
	sound alarm when needed. (PWM if you want)
	communicate through wire
		one micro-controller has sensors
		the other one gives information to user
	
	user can input 4 number password.
		submit button 		(e.g. keypad)
		backspace button 	(e.g. keypad)
		timeout for password input

		"correct!" -> alarms don't do anything (aka buzzer just returns?)
		"incorrect!"
		"timeout!"

	state machine structure
