This file contains notes and thoughts that went into designing the system.
Some of this is just reinterpreting the exercise work task description.


first page says these things:
ONE HAS TO DO THESE
	sense movement, which causes an alarm
	read keypad

THE OTHER ONE HAS TO
	display alarm system state
		password input

		examples?:
			connection status
			movement detection
			password time limit ran out
			similar features

EITHER HAS TO
	sound alarm when needed.


so the system needs to:
	detect motion
	sound alarm when needed. (PWM if you want)
	communicate through wire
		one micro-controller has sensors
		the other one gives information to user
	
	user can input 4 number password.
		submit button 		(e.g. keypad)
		backspace button 	(e.g. keypad)
		timeout for password input

		"correct!" -> alarms don't do anything (aka buzzer just returns?)
		"incorrect!"
		"timeout!"

	state machine structure
